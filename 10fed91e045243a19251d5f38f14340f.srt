00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.004
- AI's potential to transform your business is vast,

2
00:00:04.004 --> 00:00:07.009
but make no mistake, it introduces new risks

3
00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:10.002
that demand diligent governance.

4
00:00:10.002 --> 00:00:12.009
Don't become another cautionary headline.

5
00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:17.002
Proactively prepare your organization to mitigate AI risk.

6
00:00:17.002 --> 00:00:19.005
In this video, I'll explain why any company

7
00:00:19.005 --> 00:00:21.008
that is serious about leveraging AI technology

8
00:00:21.008 --> 00:00:25.003
needs to prioritize doing an AI risk analysis.

9
00:00:25.003 --> 00:00:27.004
Any promise in technology comes with risks

10
00:00:27.004 --> 00:00:29.001
if not thoughtfully governed.

11
00:00:29.001 --> 00:00:32.004
This is especially true of AI, given the capabilities

12
00:00:32.004 --> 00:00:35.007
and access that the technology increasingly has.

13
00:00:35.007 --> 00:00:39.006
Here's why conducting a risk analysis is essential.

14
00:00:39.006 --> 00:00:42.007
One, it helps identify potential issues

15
00:00:42.007 --> 00:00:45.009
before they escalate, allowing for preventative measures

16
00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:48.002
rather than reactive ones.

17
00:00:48.002 --> 00:00:51.001
Two, it ensures that you meet legal

18
00:00:51.001 --> 00:00:52.009
and regulatory requirements

19
00:00:52.009 --> 00:00:56.007
and reduces the risk of penalties or legal challenges.

20
00:00:56.007 --> 00:00:59.003
Three, it'll help to identify

21
00:00:59.003 --> 00:01:02.004
and mitigate biases or ethical concerns.

22
00:01:02.004 --> 00:01:05.007
This is crucial to maintain trust with your consumers

23
00:01:05.007 --> 00:01:08.007
and upholding your corporate responsibility.

24
00:01:08.007 --> 00:01:10.008
And four, it will ultimately help

25
00:01:10.008 --> 00:01:12.009
identify operational challenges

26
00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:14.009
and contribute to smoother integration

27
00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:17.005
and deployment of your AI technologies.

28
00:01:17.005 --> 00:01:18.006
So how do you go about

29
00:01:18.006 --> 00:01:21.006
actually conducting an AI risk analysis?

30
00:01:21.006 --> 00:01:24.006
First, assemble a team, ideally consisting

31
00:01:24.006 --> 00:01:27.009
of legal, risk management, and technical experts.

32
00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:30.003
Then, start creating a detailed catalog

33
00:01:30.003 --> 00:01:33.000
of AI risk specific to your business.

34
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.004
It's important to involve various stakeholders,

35
00:01:35.004 --> 00:01:39.001
including employees, customers, and external experts

36
00:01:39.001 --> 00:01:42.006
to get diverse perspectives on potential risks.

37
00:01:42.006 --> 00:01:46.003
I recommend that you focus on four key areas,

38
00:01:46.003 --> 00:01:49.007
one, data security, privacy, and permissions,

39
00:01:49.007 --> 00:01:51.006
two, model safety issues,

40
00:01:51.006 --> 00:01:54.007
such as hallucination and harmful content,

41
00:01:54.007 --> 00:01:57.004
three, ethical issues around bias,

42
00:01:57.004 --> 00:01:59.008
transparency, and intellectual property,

43
00:01:59.008 --> 00:02:04.000
and four, legal and regulatory compliance.

44
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.006
For each area, catalog existing controls

45
00:02:06.006 --> 00:02:08.004
and rank the likelihood and impact levels

46
00:02:08.004 --> 00:02:10.005
of incidents if they occur,

47
00:02:10.005 --> 00:02:13.004
then detail specific steps engineering, product,

48
00:02:13.004 --> 00:02:16.003
and legal teams must take to strengthen policies,

49
00:02:16.003 --> 00:02:18.004
monitoring, and responses.

50
00:02:18.004 --> 00:02:20.003
You can leverage established frameworks

51
00:02:20.003 --> 00:02:23.001
like the National Institute of Standards and Technologies,

52
00:02:23.001 --> 00:02:25.000
AI Risk Management Framework,

53
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
or Deloitte's Trustworthy AI Framework

54
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.008
to guide your process.

55
00:02:28.008 --> 00:02:31.005
These frameworks offer structured methodologies

56
00:02:31.005 --> 00:02:33.001
for identifying and manage risk

57
00:02:33.001 --> 00:02:36.004
tailored to an organization's unique needs.

58
00:02:36.004 --> 00:02:39.003
Ultimately, recognize that continuous monitoring

59
00:02:39.003 --> 00:02:41.004
and adaptability will be needed.

60
00:02:41.004 --> 00:02:43.005
With AI technologies rapidly evolving

61
00:02:43.005 --> 00:02:45.004
and regulatory landscapes shifting,

62
00:02:45.004 --> 00:02:48.005
it's crucial to regularly update your risk analysis

63
00:02:48.005 --> 00:02:50.009
to stay ahead of new challenges.

64
00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:53.000
Now that you have watched this video,

65
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.008
I encourage you to take some time

66
00:02:54.008 --> 00:02:58.002
to review the NIST's AI Risk Management Framework,

67
00:02:58.002 --> 00:03:01.009
and then proceed to create a robust AI risk management plan.

68
00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:05.007
Remember, the goal is to proactively manage AI risk,

69
00:03:05.007 --> 00:03:09.007
ensuring your AI initiatives are both innovative and safe.

70
00:03:09.007 --> 00:03:12.003
By doing so, you'll be setting your organization

71
00:03:12.003 --> 00:03:14.004
on a path to not just mitigate risk,

72
00:03:14.004 --> 00:03:18.003
but also to leverage AI responsibly and effectively.

73
00:03:18.003 --> 00:03:21.003
Prioritize mitigation planning can help prevent AI failures

74
00:03:21.003 --> 00:03:23.008
or scandals before they emerge.

75
00:03:23.008 --> 00:03:26.001
Don't wait for an incident to happen

76
00:03:26.001 --> 00:03:27.005
before you begin to act.
