- As companies unveil

2
00:00:02.003 --> 00:00:03.009
evermore remarkable generative AI

3
00:00:03.009 --> 00:00:07.002
capabilities in the form of new products and services,

4
00:00:07.002 --> 00:00:08.008
it's understandable to be eager

5
00:00:08.008 --> 00:00:12.002
to test the innovative possibilities they present.

6
00:00:12.002 --> 00:00:15.006
I'm the voice in the room telling you to wait.

7
00:00:15.006 --> 00:00:17.003
AI should not drive strategy.

8
00:00:17.003 --> 00:00:21.009
Your business strategy should drive AI implementation.

9
00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:24.001
This means identifying the business problems

10
00:00:24.001 --> 00:00:25.007
and goals first,

11
00:00:25.007 --> 00:00:30.000
then evaluating if and how AI can add value.

12
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.009
Beware of starting a generative AI initiative simply

13
00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.001
because it's the hot new thing right now.

14
00:00:36.001 --> 00:00:38.004
Adopting AI technology for technology's sake

15
00:00:38.004 --> 00:00:40.000
rarely delivers value.

16
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.009
The key is to ground your AI initiatives in

17
00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:45.004
practical business needs.

18
00:00:45.004 --> 00:00:48.001
In this video, I'll show you how to identify

19
00:00:48.001 --> 00:00:50.009
and prioritize AI use cases based on real

20
00:00:50.009 --> 00:00:53.000
business goals and challenges.

21
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.005
This will set up impactful

22
00:00:54.005 --> 00:00:58.000
and relevant AI adoption across your organization.

23
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.009
Here's how you can go about doing it.

24
00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:05.006
First, clarify your key organizational objectives.

25
00:01:05.006 --> 00:01:07.006
What business challenges are you facing?

26
00:01:07.006 --> 00:01:09.006
Increased cost pressures,

27
00:01:09.006 --> 00:01:10.008
poor customer retention,

28
00:01:10.008 --> 00:01:12.008
supply chain disruptions.

29
00:01:12.008 --> 00:01:16.001
The goal here is to outline tangible problems.

30
00:01:16.001 --> 00:01:19.007
Next, analyze where inefficiency bottlenecks,

31
00:01:19.007 --> 00:01:22.008
or waste exist in your core operations.

32
00:01:22.008 --> 00:01:24.001
Where could automation

33
00:01:24.001 --> 00:01:27.009
or optimization drive dramatic improvements?

34
00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:30.009
Now using your investment in AI literacy

35
00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:32.001
and increased understanding

36
00:01:32.001 --> 00:01:34.004
of generative AI capabilities and solutions,

37
00:01:34.004 --> 00:01:35.009
which we covered in the previous lesson,

38
00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.007
you can begin to brainstorm

39
00:01:37.007 --> 00:01:39.009
how AI can alleviate pain points

40
00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:42.008
or help you capitalize on opportunities.

41
00:01:42.008 --> 00:01:45.004
For instance, if reducing response times

42
00:01:45.004 --> 00:01:47.009
for customer service requests is your priority,

43
00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.003
AI powered chatbots might be a helpful solution to explore.

44
00:01:51.003 --> 00:01:54.000
Or perhaps you want a conversational AI assistant

45
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
that can improve the closing ratios

46
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.007
of your sales execs by 5%

47
00:01:57.007 --> 00:02:01.000
by providing product expertise in real-time.

48
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.003
The idea is to align AI solutions

49
00:02:03.003 --> 00:02:06.000
to your specific business problems.

50
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.001
You should screen use cases against criteria like

51
00:02:08.001 --> 00:02:11.000
feasibility, business impact, and effort required.

52
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.006
It can also be helpful to categorize use cases into types.

53
00:02:14.006 --> 00:02:16.008
For example, revenue boosting, cost saving,

54
00:02:16.008 --> 00:02:20.002
risk reduction, employee assistance, etc.

55
00:02:20.002 --> 00:02:22.000
The crucial thing to remember is

56
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.005
that not every problem is best solved with AI,

57
00:02:24.005 --> 00:02:27.007
and it's important to evaluate whether the expected return

58
00:02:27.007 --> 00:02:29.007
on investment justifies the resources

59
00:02:29.007 --> 00:02:32.002
and effort needed.

60
00:02:32.002 --> 00:02:33.004
Throughout this process,

61
00:02:33.004 --> 00:02:36.001
be sure to include stakeholders from different functions

62
00:02:36.001 --> 00:02:38.007
to tap into diverse perspectives.

63
00:02:38.007 --> 00:02:40.003
Their insights can reveal opportunities

64
00:02:40.003 --> 00:02:42.002
you might not have considered

65
00:02:42.002 --> 00:02:44.005
and will help ensure that AI solutions resonate

66
00:02:44.005 --> 00:02:46.007
with the people using them.

67
00:02:46.007 --> 00:02:48.001
To put this into practice,

68
00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:50.002
consider hosting brainstorming session with team leaders

69
00:02:50.002 --> 00:02:54.000
to identify pain points that AI could alleviate.

70
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.004
Be sure to stay informed about industry trends

71
00:02:56.004 --> 00:02:58.008
and explore use cases to understand how businesses

72
00:02:58.008 --> 00:03:01.001
similar to yours are utilized in AI.

73
00:03:01.001 --> 00:03:04.000
And more importantly, engage with AI experts

74
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.008
or consultants who can provide an external perspective on

75
00:03:06.008 --> 00:03:09.000
the technical and strategic feasibility

76
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.003
of your AI initiatives.

77
00:03:11.003 --> 00:03:13.007
By focusing on identifying AI use cases

78
00:03:13.007 --> 00:03:14.009
that are closely aligned with your businesses'

79
00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:16.001
challenges and goals,

80
00:03:16.001 --> 00:03:18.002
you ensure that your AI initiatives

81
00:03:18.002 --> 00:03:20.003
are not just technologically sound,

82
00:03:20.003 --> 00:03:22.002
but also strategically valuable.
