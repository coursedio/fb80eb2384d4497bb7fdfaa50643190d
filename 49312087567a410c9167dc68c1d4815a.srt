00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:02.004
- Investing in generative AI

2
00:00:02.004 --> 00:00:04.009
is not just about embracing new technology,

3
00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:07.009
it's about driving real business value.

4
00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:12.002
But how do you measure the success of your AI initiatives?

5
00:00:12.002 --> 00:00:14.006
In this video, I'll provide you with a framework

6
00:00:14.006 --> 00:00:17.006
for accurately evaluating your AI solutions performance

7
00:00:17.006 --> 00:00:20.009
and return on investments, including metrics, costs,

8
00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:23.005
and overall business impact.

9
00:00:23.005 --> 00:00:25.004
When evaluating your AI initiatives,

10
00:00:25.004 --> 00:00:27.009
first, revisit the key performance indicators

11
00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:29.009
and milestones that you would've created

12
00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:33.007
during the AI roadmap goal alignment section of this course.

13
00:00:33.007 --> 00:00:37.005
These are your evaluation North Stars.

14
00:00:37.005 --> 00:00:39.004
Assess both quantitative metrics

15
00:00:39.004 --> 00:00:41.009
like usage analytics, and conversions,

16
00:00:41.009 --> 00:00:43.008
and qualitative feedback like surveys

17
00:00:43.008 --> 00:00:47.003
and interviews from staff and customers.

18
00:00:47.003 --> 00:00:50.005
Quantitative data reveals the who, what, and when,

19
00:00:50.005 --> 00:00:53.009
while qualitative data offers the why.

20
00:00:53.009 --> 00:00:56.004
Next, determine comprehensive costs

21
00:00:56.004 --> 00:00:59.000
over your AI solutions full lifecycle.

22
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.006
From research to post-deployment oversight

23
00:01:01.006 --> 00:01:04.001
including maintenance, monitoring upgrades,

24
00:01:04.001 --> 00:01:06.005
and responsible deprecation.

25
00:01:06.005 --> 00:01:08.001
With targets and cost clarified,

26
00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:11.003
you can now begin to calculate business impact.

27
00:01:11.003 --> 00:01:13.002
Intangible terms for example.

28
00:01:13.002 --> 00:01:15.007
If your AI chat bot boosted sales conversion

29
00:01:15.007 --> 00:01:18.008
rates by 7%, you can determine precisely

30
00:01:18.008 --> 00:01:20.008
how much additional revenue that yielded

31
00:01:20.008 --> 00:01:23.005
and compare it against total costs.

32
00:01:23.005 --> 00:01:27.004
This cost benefit analysis determines return on investment,

33
00:01:27.004 --> 00:01:30.009
a metric crucial for executive decision making.

34
00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:34.001
However, traditional ROI calculations focusing solely

35
00:01:34.001 --> 00:01:35.004
on direct financial gains

36
00:01:35.004 --> 00:01:40.000
versus implementation costs don't always apply neatly to AI.

37
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.007
AI impacts include both Hard ROI,

38
00:01:42.007 --> 00:01:45.003
such as direct financial gains like cost savings,

39
00:01:45.003 --> 00:01:49.004
and Soft ROI, broader benefits like employee satisfaction,

40
00:01:49.004 --> 00:01:52.009
decision agility improvements, and future readiness.

41
00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:56.001
You'll need to formulate frameworks to quantify both.

42
00:01:56.001 --> 00:01:59.005
So catalog all measurable cost and time savings,

43
00:01:59.005 --> 00:02:02.008
revenue and productivity lifts as Hard ROI

44
00:02:02.008 --> 00:02:04.004
would also develop indicators

45
00:02:04.004 --> 00:02:06.006
and measures to value software upsides

46
00:02:06.006 --> 00:02:09.001
like skills development, brand enhancement,

47
00:02:09.001 --> 00:02:11.002
and anticipatory capacity.

48
00:02:11.002 --> 00:02:13.009
Stay nimble and reevaluate KPIs

49
00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:16.004
and ROI analyses as markets shift

50
00:02:16.004 --> 00:02:19.003
so you can course correct if needed.

51
00:02:19.003 --> 00:02:22.002
Through accurate evaluation of real world performance

52
00:02:22.002 --> 00:02:24.001
and future strategic impact,

53
00:02:24.001 --> 00:02:25.009
you can justify investments to unlock

54
00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:29.000
AI's last and transformative potential in your business.
