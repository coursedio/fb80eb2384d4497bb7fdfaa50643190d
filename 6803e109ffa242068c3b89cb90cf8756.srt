00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:02.006
- [Instructor] Strategizing and planning is key,

2
00:00:02.006 --> 00:00:03.006
but let's be clear.

3
00:00:03.006 --> 00:00:07.004
There's no ROI in AI unless you execute.

4
00:00:07.004 --> 00:00:09.004
In theory, generative AI presents

5
00:00:09.004 --> 00:00:11.007
tremendous opportunities for your business,

6
00:00:11.007 --> 00:00:12.007
but in practice,

7
00:00:12.007 --> 00:00:14.006
the difference between success and failure

8
00:00:14.006 --> 00:00:15.009
is in how effectively

9
00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:19.001
you can move from strategy to implementation.

10
00:00:19.001 --> 00:00:20.009
In this video, I'll guide you through

11
00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:22.002
developing an action plan

12
00:00:22.002 --> 00:00:24.008
to operationalize your generative AI strategy.

13
00:00:24.008 --> 00:00:26.006
By the end, you'll be equipped

14
00:00:26.006 --> 00:00:28.001
to translate your strategic vision

15
00:00:28.001 --> 00:00:30.001
into specific actionable tasks

16
00:00:30.001 --> 00:00:32.007
that can help you succeed.

17
00:00:32.007 --> 00:00:34.007
Turning your AI strategy into realities

18
00:00:34.007 --> 00:00:36.003
like navigating a new path.

19
00:00:36.003 --> 00:00:40.005
It requires both a map and the agility to adapt.

20
00:00:40.005 --> 00:00:41.007
You have laid the groundwork.

21
00:00:41.007 --> 00:00:44.000
Now let's focus on the practical steps

22
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.008
to ensure your journey from AI strategy

23
00:00:45.008 --> 00:00:50.003
to execution is both effective and efficient.

24
00:00:50.003 --> 00:00:52.002
It is best to start small in scope.

25
00:00:52.002 --> 00:00:54.000
Deploy solutions quickly.

26
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.003
Gather user feedback.

27
00:00:55.003 --> 00:00:57.006
Improve and repeat.

28
00:00:57.006 --> 00:00:59.004
If you're building a product for customers

29
00:00:59.004 --> 00:01:02.001
for example, develop a minimum viable prototype

30
00:01:02.001 --> 00:01:05.004
to test critical functionality with real users.

31
00:01:05.004 --> 00:01:08.000
Embrace an iterative process.

32
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.004
Rather than aiming for perfection

33
00:01:09.004 --> 00:01:10.003
in the first go,

34
00:01:10.003 --> 00:01:12.005
focus on continuous improvement based on

35
00:01:12.005 --> 00:01:15.000
a real world usage and feedback.

36
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.001
For AI implementations, focus on simple,

37
00:01:18.001 --> 00:01:20.008
helpful, visible use cases first.

38
00:01:20.008 --> 00:01:24.005
Use your roadmap to guide prioritization.

39
00:01:24.005 --> 00:01:26.007
It is important to choose narrow problems

40
00:01:26.007 --> 00:01:29.007
where AI can augment teams seamlessly.

41
00:01:29.007 --> 00:01:31.006
User buying accelerates adoption.

42
00:01:31.006 --> 00:01:33.009
So your goal is to win user confidence

43
00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:36.000
through added value.

44
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.007
Remember, generative AI empowers teams

45
00:01:38.007 --> 00:01:41.007
to iterate at exponentially faster speeds.

46
00:01:41.007 --> 00:01:43.008
You should be that nimble adaptability

47
00:01:43.008 --> 00:01:47.002
into implementation frameworks from the start.

48
00:01:47.002 --> 00:01:48.009
Empower cross-functional teams

49
00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:50.005
owning end-to-end use cases

50
00:01:50.005 --> 00:01:52.008
to learn rapidly by doing.

51
00:01:52.008 --> 00:01:54.001
Let them build momentum

52
00:01:54.001 --> 00:01:55.009
by delivering a continual stream

53
00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:00.003
of small AI advances versus big bang deployments.

54
00:02:00.003 --> 00:02:02.000
This agile approach allows you

55
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.002
to pivot dynamically based on user data,

56
00:02:04.002 --> 00:02:07.001
and feedback from solution prototypes.

57
00:02:07.001 --> 00:02:08.003
Ensure clear communication

58
00:02:08.003 --> 00:02:10.009
about the role and benefits of AI.

59
00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.006
Provide training sessions that are tailored

60
00:02:12.006 --> 00:02:13.009
to different user groups,

61
00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:15.001
helping them understand,

62
00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:18.000
and adapt to the new tools and processes.

63
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Enable adoption through involvement,

64
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.001
and build learning velocity into your teams.

65
00:02:23.001 --> 00:02:25.004
Lastly, recognize that AI technology

66
00:02:25.004 --> 00:02:26.007
is rapidly advancing,

67
00:02:26.007 --> 00:02:28.001
so you'll need to build flexibility

68
00:02:28.001 --> 00:02:30.002
into your plans right from the start.

69
00:02:30.002 --> 00:02:33.006
For example, use containerized modular components

70
00:02:33.006 --> 00:02:35.007
that allow for easier experimentation,

71
00:02:35.007 --> 00:02:38.000
change and reusability.

72
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.007
This will ensure that as the technology

73
00:02:39.007 --> 00:02:41.002
inevitably becomes more capable,

74
00:02:41.002 --> 00:02:43.005
you can quickly adapt accordingly.

75
00:02:43.005 --> 00:02:46.000
Operationalizing your AI strategy

76
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.001
is about taking calculated practical steps.

77
00:02:49.001 --> 00:02:52.001
By starting small, focusing on impactful areas,

78
00:02:52.001 --> 00:02:54.000
and using an iterative approach,

79
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.004
you can navigate the complexities

80
00:02:55.004 --> 00:02:58.003
of AI implementation effectively.

81
00:02:58.003 --> 00:03:00.009
Your goal now is to take these recommendations

82
00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:03.005
tailor them to your organization's context,

83
00:03:03.005 --> 00:03:05.000
and start the journey of transforming

84
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.009
your AI strategy into tangible business outcomes.
