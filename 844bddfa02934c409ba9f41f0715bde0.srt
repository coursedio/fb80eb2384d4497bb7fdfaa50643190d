00:00:00.003 --> 00:00:03.007
- Generative AI is rapidly reshaping business landscapes,

2
00:00:03.007 --> 00:00:05.006
but you can't effectively navigate

3
00:00:05.006 --> 00:00:07.006
what you don't understand.

4
00:00:07.006 --> 00:00:10.002
Yes, companies are over-eager to jump in

5
00:00:10.002 --> 00:00:12.006
and implement this powerful new technology,

6
00:00:12.006 --> 00:00:14.001
but without diligent planning,

7
00:00:14.001 --> 00:00:16.003
attempted AI solutions often fail,

8
00:00:16.003 --> 00:00:20.000
waste resources, or bear unanticipated risk.

9
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.001
Hi, my name is Chris McKay,

10
00:00:22.001 --> 00:00:24.007
and I'm the founder and CEO of Maginative.

11
00:00:24.007 --> 00:00:27.004
Maginative provides AI education and training services

12
00:00:27.004 --> 00:00:29.002
for organizations like yours,

13
00:00:29.002 --> 00:00:32.009
looking to level up and win with new AI technologies.

14
00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.003
We have developed a framework for adopting AI

15
00:00:35.003 --> 00:00:37.002
that stitches together business goals,

16
00:00:37.002 --> 00:00:39.000
requirements auditing, solution mapping,

17
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.001
change management, and adoption and iteration

18
00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:44.006
into one coherent strategy.

19
00:00:44.006 --> 00:00:45.006
So if you're ready to learn

20
00:00:45.006 --> 00:00:47.009
how you can strategically adopt generative AI

21
00:00:47.009 --> 00:00:49.004
in your organization,

22
00:00:49.004 --> 00:00:50.002
let's jump in.
