00:00:00.004 --> 00:00:03.001
- Implementing generative AI in your business

2
00:00:03.001 --> 00:00:05.006
isn't a one size fits all journey.

3
00:00:05.006 --> 00:00:08.005
Each organization's path to AI adoption is unique,

4
00:00:08.005 --> 00:00:11.009
shaped by its specific needs, goals, and context.

5
00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:13.007
So how can you ensure

6
00:00:13.007 --> 00:00:16.001
that the usage framework aligns perfectly

7
00:00:16.001 --> 00:00:18.008
with your company's distinctive landscape?

8
00:00:18.008 --> 00:00:21.000
In this final segment, we'll explore how

9
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.008
to customize the usage framework

10
00:00:22.008 --> 00:00:25.008
to fit your business' unique requirements.

11
00:00:25.008 --> 00:00:28.005
You learn to adapt each step of the framework to align

12
00:00:28.005 --> 00:00:31.009
with your organization's specific AI aspirations,

13
00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:35.009
ensuring a successful and impactful adoption.

14
00:00:35.009 --> 00:00:37.006
Adapting the usage framework begins

15
00:00:37.006 --> 00:00:38.009
with a deep understanding

16
00:00:38.009 --> 00:00:41.006
of your organization's unique environment.

17
00:00:41.006 --> 00:00:44.008
So reflect on your specific industry challenges,

18
00:00:44.008 --> 00:00:46.003
your team's capabilities,

19
00:00:46.003 --> 00:00:49.005
and the unique value you seek from AI.

20
00:00:49.005 --> 00:00:51.003
Tailor the understanding phase

21
00:00:51.003 --> 00:00:53.006
to address these specific insights.

22
00:00:53.006 --> 00:00:55.009
In the survey phase, your technical evaluation

23
00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:58.003
and skills gap analysis should be customized

24
00:00:58.003 --> 00:01:01.007
to your current infrastructure and workforce competencies.

25
00:01:01.007 --> 00:01:04.004
This ensures that the foundation you build is robust

26
00:01:04.004 --> 00:01:06.001
and relevant.

27
00:01:06.001 --> 00:01:08.009
When aligning your goals, make sure they resonate

28
00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:11.002
with your business's core objectives.

29
00:01:11.002 --> 00:01:13.009
Your AI roadmap should reflect your specific business

30
00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:16.004
timeline and resources, ensuring it's both

31
00:01:16.004 --> 00:01:19.002
ambitious and achievable.

32
00:01:19.002 --> 00:01:22.007
The guide phase is where you pilot and test AI solutions.

33
00:01:22.007 --> 00:01:24.006
Here, focus on prototypes

34
00:01:24.006 --> 00:01:27.009
and tests that address your unique business scenarios.

35
00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:30.008
This ensures that the solutions developed are finely tuned

36
00:01:30.008 --> 00:01:33.003
to your operational needs.

37
00:01:33.003 --> 00:01:36.009
Finally, in the evaluate phase, your performance analysis

38
00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:39.006
and scaling decisions should be based on criteria

39
00:01:39.006 --> 00:01:42.002
that reflect your business' success metrics.

40
00:01:42.002 --> 00:01:44.006
Whether it's enhancing customer experience,

41
00:01:44.006 --> 00:01:46.006
improving operational efficiency,

42
00:01:46.006 --> 00:01:48.003
or driving innovation,

43
00:01:48.003 --> 00:01:51.006
ensure your evaluation metrics mirror these goals.

44
00:01:51.006 --> 00:01:54.005
Remember, the usage framework is dynamic.

45
00:01:54.005 --> 00:01:57.007
It's designed to be revisited and revised as your business

46
00:01:57.007 --> 00:01:59.007
and the AI landscape evolves.

47
00:01:59.007 --> 00:02:01.006
So stay flexible, keep learning,

48
00:02:01.006 --> 00:02:03.004
and continuously adapt the framework

49
00:02:03.004 --> 00:02:04.007
to remain at the forefront

50
00:02:04.007 --> 00:02:07.002
of AI-driven business transformation.

51
00:02:07.002 --> 00:02:10.008
So reflect on your AI aspirations, leverage the flexibility

52
00:02:10.008 --> 00:02:12.002
of the usage framework

53
00:02:12.002 --> 00:02:15.006
and embark on a journey that's uniquely yours.

54
00:02:15.006 --> 00:02:18.001
With this approach, you're not just adopting AI,

55
00:02:18.001 --> 00:02:20.000
you're shaping it to be a pivotal part

56
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.003
of your business's future.
