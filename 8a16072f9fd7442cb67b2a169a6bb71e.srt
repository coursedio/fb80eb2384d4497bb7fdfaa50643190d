00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:03.003
- The second phase of our framework Survey

2
00:00:03.003 --> 00:00:06.004
involves conducting a feasibility assessment.

3
00:00:06.004 --> 00:00:08.006
It's about looking closely at your business

4
00:00:08.006 --> 00:00:10.006
and understanding your organization's

5
00:00:10.006 --> 00:00:12.009
current state of AI readiness.

6
00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:14.007
This starts with the technical requirements

7
00:00:14.007 --> 00:00:18.001
of any AI solution that you plan to adopt.

8
00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:20.009
Whether you're using SaaS-based AI products,

9
00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:23.003
fine tuning models on your own infrastructure,

10
00:00:23.003 --> 00:00:25.002
or accessing proprietary ones

11
00:00:25.002 --> 00:00:28.006
like Gemini, Claude, or GBT via an API,

12
00:00:28.006 --> 00:00:32.004
technical requirements are an essential consideration.

13
00:00:32.004 --> 00:00:34.003
In this video, I'll walk you through

14
00:00:34.003 --> 00:00:37.001
how to draft an AI technical requirements document

15
00:00:37.001 --> 00:00:39.008
that outlines the technology and infrastructure needed

16
00:00:39.008 --> 00:00:42.003
to support your generative AI initiatives.

17
00:00:42.003 --> 00:00:46.001
Your AI technical requirements document has twin objectives.

18
00:00:46.001 --> 00:00:49.005
First, it audits current organizational capabilities

19
00:00:49.005 --> 00:00:52.006
related to data, infrastructure, software, et cetera.

20
00:00:52.006 --> 00:00:55.003
And secondly, it defines what is needed to build

21
00:00:55.003 --> 00:00:57.009
or adopt preferred solutions.

22
00:00:57.009 --> 00:01:00.003
In crafting your AI technical requirements document,

23
00:01:00.003 --> 00:01:02.006
here are some elements to review.

24
00:01:02.006 --> 00:01:05.008
Firstly, audit your compute infrastructure.

25
00:01:05.008 --> 00:01:07.005
If you are building a custom solution,

26
00:01:07.005 --> 00:01:10.001
you must decide between running your own models

27
00:01:10.001 --> 00:01:12.001
or using APIs.

28
00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:14.000
Running your models on your own infrastructure

29
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.005
may provide greater control,

30
00:01:15.005 --> 00:01:18.003
but demands comprehensive infrastructure management,

31
00:01:18.003 --> 00:01:22.001
including sophisticated hardware and skilled personnel.

32
00:01:22.001 --> 00:01:24.008
Alternatively, using a managed service or API

33
00:01:24.008 --> 00:01:27.000
will provide access to more advanced models

34
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.009
and allow you to focus on your product development.

35
00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.001
Your choice should align with your organization's

36
00:01:32.001 --> 00:01:33.007
needs and capabilities,

37
00:01:33.007 --> 00:01:37.005
balancing both domain expertise with cost efficiency.

38
00:01:37.005 --> 00:01:40.005
Next, recognize that a modern data foundation

39
00:01:40.005 --> 00:01:42.000
is an absolute prerequisite

40
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.007
for effectively leveraging generative AI.

41
00:01:44.007 --> 00:01:45.006
You'll need to catalog

42
00:01:45.006 --> 00:01:48.002
your data sources, quality, and security,

43
00:01:48.002 --> 00:01:51.000
and assess your organization's data availability,

44
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.008
governance policies, and preparedness.

45
00:01:53.008 --> 00:01:57.000
You should also consider how seamlessly your AI solution

46
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.007
integrates with existing systems and their scalability.

47
00:02:00.007 --> 00:02:02.002
As a foundational technology,

48
00:02:02.002 --> 00:02:06.003
you want your AI to evolve alongside your business.

49
00:02:06.003 --> 00:02:10.000
Next, environmental impacts should not be overlooked.

50
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.009
The energy requirements of AI models,

51
00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.007
especially when developing your own,

52
00:02:13.007 --> 00:02:15.000
can significantly affect

53
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.004
your organization's carbon footprint.

54
00:02:17.004 --> 00:02:19.005
Be sure to assess this.

55
00:02:19.005 --> 00:02:21.007
Lastly, it's crucial to incorporate

56
00:02:21.007 --> 00:02:23.004
a comprehensive budget estimate

57
00:02:23.004 --> 00:02:25.008
in your AI technical requirements document.

58
00:02:25.008 --> 00:02:27.008
This should include all potential costs

59
00:02:27.008 --> 00:02:29.002
such as licensing fees

60
00:02:29.002 --> 00:02:31.004
for proprietary AI models or software,

61
00:02:31.004 --> 00:02:32.009
and the expenses associated

62
00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:35.009
with infrastructure development or upgrades.

63
00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:38.006
Additionally, consider the ongoing operational costs

64
00:02:38.006 --> 00:02:41.001
such as technical support, data management,

65
00:02:41.001 --> 00:02:44.003
and any necessary staff training or hiring.

66
00:02:44.003 --> 00:02:47.003
In summary, defining the AI technical requirements

67
00:02:47.003 --> 00:02:50.006
is essential for successful implementation and adoption,

68
00:02:50.006 --> 00:02:52.008
whether you're running models on your own infrastructure

69
00:02:52.008 --> 00:02:55.004
or leveraging API-based services.

70
00:02:55.004 --> 00:02:58.003
So I challenge you take some time after this video

71
00:02:58.003 --> 00:03:01.006
and thoroughly document and assess your needs across data,

72
00:03:01.006 --> 00:03:04.006
infrastructure, software, processes, and costs

73
00:03:04.006 --> 00:03:07.005
to ensure your AI initiatives are technically sound

74
00:03:07.005 --> 00:03:09.001
and strategically aligned.

75
00:03:09.001 --> 00:03:11.005
We'll build on this document in the next video.
