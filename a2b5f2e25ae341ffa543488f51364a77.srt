00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:02.000
- Organizing your business

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.005
for AI success requires thoughtful leadership

3
00:00:04.005 --> 00:00:06.000
and ownership structures.

4
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:06.009
I get it,

5
00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:09.009
governance and organizational design isn't exciting,

6
00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:12.007
but it is utterly foundational.

7
00:00:12.007 --> 00:00:14.001
AI solutions live

8
00:00:14.001 --> 00:00:17.005
or die based on operating models wrapped around them.

9
00:00:17.005 --> 00:00:18.005
Here's how you want to think

10
00:00:18.005 --> 00:00:20.009
about approaching structuring AI leadership and ownership

11
00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:22.005
in your business.

12
00:00:22.005 --> 00:00:26.001
First, appoint a dedicated AI leader or group,

13
00:00:26.001 --> 00:00:28.007
ideally someone at the executive level.

14
00:00:28.007 --> 00:00:30.008
Their main responsibilities should include

15
00:00:30.008 --> 00:00:33.008
informing AI strategy, facilitating governance,

16
00:00:33.008 --> 00:00:36.008
managing partnerships, and guide and adoption.

17
00:00:36.008 --> 00:00:40.002
Second, implement cross-functional AI committees

18
00:00:40.002 --> 00:00:43.007
with representatives from business units impacted by AI.

19
00:00:43.007 --> 00:00:46.007
These groups can align on standards, use cases,

20
00:00:46.007 --> 00:00:48.005
risks, and roadmaps.

21
00:00:48.005 --> 00:00:51.005
Importantly, they act as two-way conduits,

22
00:00:51.005 --> 00:00:53.008
disseminating strategy down through the org

23
00:00:53.008 --> 00:00:56.006
and feedback up decision makers.

24
00:00:56.006 --> 00:00:58.006
Depending on the size of your organization,

25
00:00:58.006 --> 00:01:00.008
you can also consider subcommittees focused

26
00:01:00.008 --> 00:01:04.003
on areas like HR, IT infrastructure, finance,

27
00:01:04.003 --> 00:01:07.001
risk, ethics, and compliance.

28
00:01:07.001 --> 00:01:09.009
The more voices represented the better.

29
00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:13.002
Lastly, establish clear AI solution ownership

30
00:01:13.002 --> 00:01:16.001
at the team level where rubber meets the road.

31
00:01:16.001 --> 00:01:19.000
Designate product managers specifically empowered

32
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.004
to drive adoption of new AI tools

33
00:01:21.004 --> 00:01:24.005
or to deliver solutions to customers.

34
00:01:24.005 --> 00:01:26.007
These end-to-end owners can liaise

35
00:01:26.007 --> 00:01:29.009
with technical AI teams on tooling, while also coordinating

36
00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.005
with change management for the business users impacted.

37
00:01:33.005 --> 00:01:36.005
Their ownership builds accountability.

38
00:01:36.005 --> 00:01:38.007
Laying this foundation of multi-tiered leadership

39
00:01:38.007 --> 00:01:41.002
and ownership delivers strategic oversight

40
00:01:41.002 --> 00:01:43.009
and direction, while still encouraging agility

41
00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:46.004
through decentralized decision making.

42
00:01:46.004 --> 00:01:47.007
It also fosters learning

43
00:01:47.007 --> 00:01:50.007
and best practice sharing across the organization,

44
00:01:50.007 --> 00:01:53.005
helping to scale AI competency.

45
00:01:53.005 --> 00:01:56.007
Decisive organizational design reduces bottlenecks,

46
00:01:56.007 --> 00:01:59.001
misalignment, and a duplication of efforts

47
00:01:59.001 --> 00:02:01.002
that can otherwise throttle AI success

48
00:02:01.002 --> 00:02:03.002
and value realization.

49
00:02:03.002 --> 00:02:05.003
After watching this video, take some time

50
00:02:05.003 --> 00:02:07.005
to reflect on your current AI governance,

51
00:02:07.005 --> 00:02:09.002
identify any leadership gaps

52
00:02:09.002 --> 00:02:11.006
or unclear ownership that you may need to address

53
00:02:11.006 --> 00:02:14.004
through a proposed organizational redesign.

54
00:02:14.004 --> 00:02:18.001
Remember, thoughtfully design structures empower teams,

55
00:02:18.001 --> 00:02:19.009
maintain alignment to strategy,

56
00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:22.008
and drive accountability for solution success.

57
00:02:22.008 --> 00:02:24.002
In the next video, we'll be looking

58
00:02:24.002 --> 00:02:27.002
at operationalizing your AI strategy, so stay tuned.
