- Implementing AI solutions without capable

2
00:00:03.002 --> 00:00:04.009
and enthusiastic employees

3
00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:09.000
and supporters across your organization is a non-starter.

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.009
Unfortunately, many leaders discover skill gaps too late,

5
00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:14.006
and this undermines initiatives

6
00:00:14.006 --> 00:00:17.007
after they have already made significant investment.

7
00:00:17.007 --> 00:00:19.007
In this video, I'll demonstrate how

8
00:00:19.007 --> 00:00:22.009
to systematically analyze your talent landscape

9
00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:24.007
to help pinpoint existing capabilities,

10
00:00:24.007 --> 00:00:27.007
identify skill shortages, and inform decisions

11
00:00:27.007 --> 00:00:29.008
on hiring and re-skilling.

12
00:00:29.008 --> 00:00:32.008
All of which are vital for AI success.

13
00:00:32.008 --> 00:00:37.003
So how do we perform an AI skills gap analysis?

14
00:00:37.003 --> 00:00:38.007
Well, it starts

15
00:00:38.007 --> 00:00:41.003
with understanding the specific competencies required

16
00:00:41.003 --> 00:00:44.003
for AI implementation in your business.

17
00:00:44.003 --> 00:00:46.004
This builds on your technical requirements document

18
00:00:46.004 --> 00:00:48.007
that we covered in the previous video.

19
00:00:48.007 --> 00:00:50.005
Start by identifying these roles

20
00:00:50.005 --> 00:00:52.008
and skills across technical, non-technical

21
00:00:52.008 --> 00:00:54.006
and leadership positions.

22
00:00:54.006 --> 00:00:56.004
Then compare these requirements against

23
00:00:56.004 --> 00:00:58.004
your current team's capabilities.

24
00:00:58.004 --> 00:01:00.004
Assess not only their technical skills,

25
00:01:00.004 --> 00:01:03.002
but their readiness to adapt to AI.

26
00:01:03.002 --> 00:01:04.004
Are there team members who

27
00:01:04.004 --> 00:01:06.007
with additional training could fill these roles,

28
00:01:06.007 --> 00:01:09.008
or do you need to consider hiring externally?

29
00:01:09.008 --> 00:01:13.003
Remember, re-skilling your existing team can be as crucial

30
00:01:13.003 --> 00:01:15.001
as hiring new talent.

31
00:01:15.001 --> 00:01:16.009
It's not just about filling gaps,

32
00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:20.000
but also about fostering a culture of continuous learning

33
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.003
and adaptability in the face of technology

34
00:01:22.003 --> 00:01:24.007
that is advancing this quickly.

35
00:01:24.007 --> 00:01:27.005
There are two primary skill gaps that you should focus on.

36
00:01:27.005 --> 00:01:29.006
Those across technical teams that design

37
00:01:29.006 --> 00:01:31.002
and build AI solutions

38
00:01:31.002 --> 00:01:32.008
and those across business teams

39
00:01:32.008 --> 00:01:36.000
that apply AI in their operations.

40
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.008
Technical skill gaps often revolve

41
00:01:37.008 --> 00:01:39.005
around specialized AI tasks, such

42
00:01:39.005 --> 00:01:42.004
as fine tuning models and managing data.

43
00:01:42.004 --> 00:01:44.000
Business skill gaps, on the other hand,

44
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.009
are about understanding AI's role

45
00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:49.000
and capabilities within a business context.

46
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.005
To address these gaps, start by looking internally.

47
00:01:51.005 --> 00:01:54.006
Identify AI thought leaders within your organization

48
00:01:54.006 --> 00:01:57.009
and empower them as AI evangelists.

49
00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:01.000
Focus on retraining and upskilling existing employees,

50
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.004
emphasizing not just technical skills, but also interpretive

51
00:02:04.004 --> 00:02:06.007
and cognitive abilities like creativity

52
00:02:06.007 --> 00:02:08.008
and strategic thinking.

53
00:02:08.008 --> 00:02:10.005
Consider setting up innovation labs

54
00:02:10.005 --> 00:02:14.001
and internal conferences to foster an AI-centric culture

55
00:02:14.001 --> 00:02:17.000
and collaborative learning environment.

56
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
If internal resources are insufficient,

57
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.009
you must look externally.

58
00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:23.000
This may involve hiring AI experts,

59
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.001
tapping into young talent through internships,

60
00:02:25.001 --> 00:02:26.009
or partnering with consulting firms

61
00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:29.005
with an experienced talent pool.

62
00:02:29.005 --> 00:02:33.001
Such external hiring should be strategic, focusing on areas

63
00:02:33.001 --> 00:02:36.004
where your organization lacks expertise.

64
00:02:36.004 --> 00:02:38.005
Performing an AI skills gap analysis

65
00:02:38.005 --> 00:02:41.000
and conducting a talent audit are critical steps

66
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.006
towards successful AI adoption.

67
00:02:43.006 --> 00:02:46.008
By understanding and addressing these gaps, you can ensure

68
00:02:46.008 --> 00:02:48.001
that your organization

69
00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:50.008
not only adopts AI technology effectively,

70
00:02:50.008 --> 00:02:52.005
but also remains competitive

71
00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:54.007
in a rapidly evolving digital landscape.
