00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:01.009
- Well, congrats.

2
00:00:01.009 --> 00:00:03.008
You have reached the end of the course,

3
00:00:03.008 --> 00:00:06.003
and I truly hope it was valuable.

4
00:00:06.003 --> 00:00:07.009
I know that adopting new technology

5
00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:10.000
in a company can be complicated.

6
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
This is especially true with AI,

7
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.002
given how fundamentally it changes processes and products.

8
00:00:16.002 --> 00:00:18.004
My hope is that with the usage framework,

9
00:00:18.004 --> 00:00:20.004
I have provided you with a mental model

10
00:00:20.004 --> 00:00:23.005
that you can utilize effectively to guide AI decision making

11
00:00:23.005 --> 00:00:25.004
and equip you with a flexible framework

12
00:00:25.004 --> 00:00:28.007
that you can weave into your existing business strategy.
