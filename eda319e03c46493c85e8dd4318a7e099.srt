00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:02.007
- Adopting AI in your organization

2
00:00:02.007 --> 00:00:04.005
is no longer just an option.

3
00:00:04.005 --> 00:00:08.002
It's a necessity for staying competitive and innovative.

4
00:00:08.002 --> 00:00:10.003
In this course, you'll be introduced

5
00:00:10.003 --> 00:00:12.009
to Imaginatives five-step USAGE Framework.

6
00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:14.009
A pragmatic, comprehensive guide

7
00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.000
designed for decision-makers like you

8
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.008
looking to strategically adopt AI.

9
00:00:19.008 --> 00:00:21.003
By the end of this video,

10
00:00:21.003 --> 00:00:23.003
you'll understand the framework's components,

11
00:00:23.003 --> 00:00:25.005
and how it helps to align AI initiatives

12
00:00:25.005 --> 00:00:29.000
with your organization's strategic vision.

13
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.005
Navigating the AI landscapes can seem daunting

14
00:00:31.005 --> 00:00:34.002
given how quickly the technology is advancing.

15
00:00:34.002 --> 00:00:36.008
The USAGE Framework breaks down the process

16
00:00:36.008 --> 00:00:39.004
into five intuitive stages:

17
00:00:39.004 --> 00:00:44.007
understand, survey, align, guide, and evaluate.

18
00:00:44.007 --> 00:00:48.002
First, you start by understanding AI through education

19
00:00:48.002 --> 00:00:51.009
and use case identification to set realistic expectations

20
00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:54.006
and build knowledge across your teams.

21
00:00:54.006 --> 00:00:57.006
Next, you survey your business and technology landscape

22
00:00:57.006 --> 00:00:59.004
to audit your readiness.

23
00:00:59.004 --> 00:01:02.007
This feasibility study is essential for scoping requirements

24
00:01:02.007 --> 00:01:04.008
and potential barriers.

25
00:01:04.008 --> 00:01:06.006
Then you align your planned initiatives

26
00:01:06.006 --> 00:01:08.004
to measurable business goals,

27
00:01:08.004 --> 00:01:11.004
crafting an agile roadmap to drive both short

28
00:01:11.004 --> 00:01:13.005
and long-term value.

29
00:01:13.005 --> 00:01:16.007
Next, you guide your rollout through proper governance,

30
00:01:16.007 --> 00:01:20.007
training and an iterative approach to responsible scaling.

31
00:01:20.007 --> 00:01:23.002
And finally, you evaluate performance

32
00:01:23.002 --> 00:01:24.006
through metrics and feedback,

33
00:01:24.006 --> 00:01:28.002
to analyze ROI and determine next phases.

34
00:01:28.002 --> 00:01:31.005
The USAGE Framework simplifies the AI integration journey

35
00:01:31.005 --> 00:01:34.002
into actionable and achievable steps.

36
00:01:34.002 --> 00:01:37.001
It shifts the mindset from reactive to strategic

37
00:01:37.001 --> 00:01:40.000
by ensuring alignment to business priorities early,

38
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.003
and emphasizing practical progression

39
00:01:42.003 --> 00:01:44.006
focused on continuous learning.

40
00:01:44.006 --> 00:01:45.008
In the coming videos,

41
00:01:45.008 --> 00:01:48.004
we'll dive deeper into each of the frameworks components,

42
00:01:48.004 --> 00:01:50.009
and explore practical examples and recommendations

43
00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.007
for putting this methodology into practice.

44
00:01:53.007 --> 00:01:55.003
By the end of this course,

45
00:01:55.003 --> 00:01:57.005
you will be able to craft an adoption plan

46
00:01:57.005 --> 00:01:59.005
to integrate AI systematically.

47
00:01:59.005 --> 00:02:02.006
Unlocking more value and building strategic advantage.
