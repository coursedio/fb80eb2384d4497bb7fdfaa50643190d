00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:02.009
- As I mentioned in the course introduction,

2
00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:06.008
you can't effectively navigate what you don't understand.

3
00:00:06.008 --> 00:00:08.006
That's why our usage framework starts

4
00:00:08.006 --> 00:00:10.003
with building collective understanding

5
00:00:10.003 --> 00:00:13.004
of AI capabilities and the fundamentals.

6
00:00:13.004 --> 00:00:15.005
In this video, I'm going to walk you through

7
00:00:15.005 --> 00:00:18.009
how you can develop AI literacy across your organization

8
00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:23.004
and enable greater understanding, participation, and impact.

9
00:00:23.004 --> 00:00:25.002
To fully leverage AI's potential,

10
00:00:25.002 --> 00:00:28.001
organizations need more than just the technology itself.

11
00:00:28.001 --> 00:00:29.004
They need people,

12
00:00:29.004 --> 00:00:32.000
people who deeply understand how AI works

13
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.005
and how to apply strategically.

14
00:00:34.005 --> 00:00:36.001
This ability to comprehend

15
00:00:36.001 --> 00:00:40.004
and thoughtfully use AI is what we call AI literacy.

16
00:00:40.004 --> 00:00:41.004
Here are three ways

17
00:00:41.004 --> 00:00:43.003
that you should be thinking about AI literacy

18
00:00:43.003 --> 00:00:45.002
at a strategic level.

19
00:00:45.002 --> 00:00:47.007
First is as a business advantage.

20
00:00:47.007 --> 00:00:51.001
It goes without saying that learning and understanding AI

21
00:00:51.001 --> 00:00:53.000
will empower you and your teams

22
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.004
to make more informed decisions

23
00:00:54.004 --> 00:00:56.004
on how to implement AI solutions,

24
00:00:56.004 --> 00:00:58.004
recognizing their potential impacts

25
00:00:58.004 --> 00:01:00.007
and managing risks effectively.

26
00:01:00.007 --> 00:01:03.006
This means you can deliver improved processes, products,

27
00:01:03.006 --> 00:01:05.007
and customer experiences that translate

28
00:01:05.007 --> 00:01:09.007
to tangible cost savings and revenue growth.

29
00:01:09.007 --> 00:01:12.009
Secondly, AI literacy is crucial for ensuring

30
00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:15.000
ethical and responsible use of AI,

31
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.004
including considerations of privacy, bias, and transparency.

32
00:01:19.004 --> 00:01:22.004
And finally, as AI continues to evolve,

33
00:01:22.004 --> 00:01:24.003
a workforce that is literate in AI

34
00:01:24.003 --> 00:01:26.009
will be better positioned to adapt and thrive

35
00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.001
in a rapidly changing technological landscape.

36
00:01:30.001 --> 00:01:33.007
So how can you go about effectively cultivating AI literacy

37
00:01:33.007 --> 00:01:36.000
across your teams?

38
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.009
Start by investing in training and development programs

39
00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.004
that are tailored to different roles

40
00:01:40.004 --> 00:01:41.009
within your organization.

41
00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.009
For example, executives will need

42
00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:45.007
more strategic level understanding

43
00:01:45.007 --> 00:01:49.003
while engineers require more in-depth technical knowledge.

44
00:01:49.003 --> 00:01:51.003
Also, be sure to include training

45
00:01:51.003 --> 00:01:52.009
on AI ethics and governance

46
00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:55.004
to ensure that all employees understand the importance

47
00:01:55.004 --> 00:01:59.001
of responsible AI use and where the company stands.

48
00:01:59.001 --> 00:02:01.002
If you don't have the expertise in-house,

49
00:02:01.002 --> 00:02:03.008
you'll need to partner with AI consultants that can provide

50
00:02:03.008 --> 00:02:06.008
workshops, executive keynotes, speaking engagements,

51
00:02:06.008 --> 00:02:09.004
and other structured training programs.

52
00:02:09.004 --> 00:02:11.003
Use the relevant development programs

53
00:02:11.003 --> 00:02:15.004
and modalities that work best for your organization or team.

54
00:02:15.004 --> 00:02:18.000
Where possible provide opportunities for employees

55
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.001
to work directly with AI tools and solutions.

56
00:02:21.001 --> 00:02:23.002
Practical experience is one of the best ways

57
00:02:23.002 --> 00:02:26.008
to understand the nuances and the potentials of AI.

58
00:02:26.008 --> 00:02:29.004
Make AI learning resources readily available.

59
00:02:29.004 --> 00:02:31.003
This could include internal knowledge bases,

60
00:02:31.003 --> 00:02:33.008
such as AI policies and prompt libraries,

61
00:02:33.008 --> 00:02:35.009
subscriptions to AI related publications

62
00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:37.004
like imaginative.com,

63
00:02:37.004 --> 00:02:40.008
or access to online courses like LinkedIn Learning.

64
00:02:40.008 --> 00:02:42.002
It is equally important

65
00:02:42.002 --> 00:02:45.001
that you also allocate dedicated time for learning.

66
00:02:45.001 --> 00:02:47.004
That way employees are not just squeezing it

67
00:02:47.004 --> 00:02:49.008
into their already busy schedules.

68
00:02:49.008 --> 00:02:51.001
Allocating time shows

69
00:02:51.001 --> 00:02:53.005
that the organization values AI literacy

70
00:02:53.005 --> 00:02:57.000
and is committed to investing in its employees development.

71
00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.006
Lastly, lead by example.

72
00:02:59.006 --> 00:03:03.000
You need to dedicate a time to understand AI yourself.

73
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.004
You should not only endorse AI learning initiatives,

74
00:03:05.004 --> 00:03:08.001
but also actively participate in them.

75
00:03:08.001 --> 00:03:10.006
Stay curious and informed.

76
00:03:10.006 --> 00:03:14.003
Openly ask questions and discuss learnings with your team.

77
00:03:14.003 --> 00:03:16.007
This will send a powerful message about the value

78
00:03:16.007 --> 00:03:21.005
and strategic priority of AI literacy for the organization.

79
00:03:21.005 --> 00:03:24.009
Remember, make AI literacy a strategic priority

80
00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:26.001
for your business.

81
00:03:26.001 --> 00:03:29.006
And AI literate workforce and leadership will pay dividends

82
00:03:29.006 --> 00:03:32.008
through more impactful solutions, adaptable strategies,

83
00:03:32.008 --> 00:03:35.006
and future proof competitiveness.

84
00:03:35.006 --> 00:03:37.000
After watching this video,

85
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.009
your goal is to create an action plan

86
00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:41.003
to assess your team's current AI knowledge

87
00:03:41.003 --> 00:03:43.003
and build an AI literacy roadmap

88
00:03:43.003 --> 00:03:45.003
that addresses the diverse learning needs

89
00:03:45.003 --> 00:03:47.001
of your organization.

90
00:03:47.001 --> 00:03:49.003
Engage with AI consultants if needed,

91
00:03:49.003 --> 00:03:51.004
leverage various learning resources,

92
00:03:51.004 --> 00:03:54.004
and most importantly, allocate dedicated time

93
00:03:54.004 --> 00:03:55.003
for this learning.
