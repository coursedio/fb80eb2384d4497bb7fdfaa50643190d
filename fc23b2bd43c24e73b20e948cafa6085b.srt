00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:02.009
- How do you ensure your AI initiatives

2
00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:04.002
are not just innovative,

3
00:00:04.002 --> 00:00:07.000
but also drive real business value?

4
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.006
It's an important question

5
00:00:08.006 --> 00:00:10.007
and one that's not asked enough.

6
00:00:10.007 --> 00:00:12.006
This is where an AI roadmap

7
00:00:12.006 --> 00:00:15.003
tied to your business goals comes in.

8
00:00:15.003 --> 00:00:17.004
By now, you should have an inventory

9
00:00:17.004 --> 00:00:19.008
of prioritized AI use cases in hand,

10
00:00:19.008 --> 00:00:21.003
as well as an understanding

11
00:00:21.003 --> 00:00:23.009
of the requirements and risks involved.

12
00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:28.008
Now it's time to map out a pragmatic roadmap for execution.

13
00:00:28.008 --> 00:00:31.000
An AI roadmap will provide you with a blueprint

14
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.007
for rolling out initiatives in logical phases

15
00:00:33.007 --> 00:00:37.002
based on dependencies, effort, and priority.

16
00:00:37.002 --> 00:00:39.007
However, it is critical that your initiatives

17
00:00:39.007 --> 00:00:41.007
are aligned with your business needs.

18
00:00:41.007 --> 00:00:44.005
Having measurable objectives tied to business impact

19
00:00:44.005 --> 00:00:46.007
is crucial for evaluating success

20
00:00:46.007 --> 00:00:48.009
and determining next phases.

21
00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:51.004
It also enables you to course-correct quickly

22
00:00:51.004 --> 00:00:55.000
if certain solutions are not demonstrating value.

23
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.007
Here is how you can go about developing

24
00:00:56.007 --> 00:00:58.002
an effective AI roadmap

25
00:00:58.002 --> 00:01:00.004
that can act as a guiding strategic document

26
00:01:00.004 --> 00:01:03.008
for stakeholders across your organization.

27
00:01:03.008 --> 00:01:06.007
First, group initiatives into short-term

28
00:01:06.007 --> 00:01:08.007
and long-term AI projects.

29
00:01:08.007 --> 00:01:11.009
Define concrete objectives, timelines, milestones,

30
00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:14.003
and owners for each project.

31
00:01:14.003 --> 00:01:17.001
Be realistic about effort, costs,

32
00:01:17.001 --> 00:01:19.007
and technical complexity required.

33
00:01:19.007 --> 00:01:23.006
Now, here is where tying to business value comes in.

34
00:01:23.006 --> 00:01:25.003
For each AI initiative,

35
00:01:25.003 --> 00:01:27.003
you must be able to clearly indicate

36
00:01:27.003 --> 00:01:30.001
how it ladders up to overarching business goals

37
00:01:30.001 --> 00:01:33.006
related to revenue, efficiency, risk, et cetera.

38
00:01:33.006 --> 00:01:36.006
You'll want to balance high-risk, high-reward projects

39
00:01:36.006 --> 00:01:38.005
with those that offer quick wins.

40
00:01:38.005 --> 00:01:41.001
This balance is vital for maintaining momentum

41
00:01:41.001 --> 00:01:43.008
and ensuring steady progress in AI maturity

42
00:01:43.008 --> 00:01:45.002
and business impact.

43
00:01:45.002 --> 00:01:46.006
The roadmap should clearly state

44
00:01:46.006 --> 00:01:49.004
how each project contributes to your strategic goals

45
00:01:49.004 --> 00:01:52.007
and how it will build your AI capabilities over time.

46
00:01:52.007 --> 00:01:54.003
This roadmap should be flexible

47
00:01:54.003 --> 00:01:57.007
and evolve as your AI initiatives progress.

48
00:01:57.007 --> 00:01:59.007
Be sure to build in feedback loops with users

49
00:01:59.007 --> 00:02:02.003
and continue looking out for shifts in business needs

50
00:02:02.003 --> 00:02:06.006
or new AI capabilities that may impact roadmap priorities.

51
00:02:06.006 --> 00:02:08.004
Being agile will be important

52
00:02:08.004 --> 00:02:11.003
as the technology landscape evolves.

53
00:02:11.003 --> 00:02:14.004
Lastly, ensure appropriate governance is in place

54
00:02:14.004 --> 00:02:16.009
so that AI solutions roll out responsibly,

55
00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:20.004
mitigating risks you have previously identified.

56
00:02:20.004 --> 00:02:22.008
Appropriate governance will give leadership confidence

57
00:02:22.008 --> 00:02:25.000
in the realization of business value.

58
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.002
So to wrap up,

59
00:02:26.002 --> 00:02:27.009
developing an AI roadmap

60
00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:30.004
is not just about planning AI projects,

61
00:02:30.004 --> 00:02:32.000
it's about aligning these projects

62
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.001
with your business' core objectives

63
00:02:34.001 --> 00:02:36.006
and ensuring they deliver real value.

64
00:02:36.006 --> 00:02:40.001
Remember, an effective AI roadmap is a living document.

65
00:02:40.001 --> 00:02:42.002
It's constantly evolving as your business

66
00:02:42.002 --> 00:02:44.006
and technology landscape changes.

67
00:02:44.006 --> 00:02:46.007
Your goal now is to use this roadmap

68
00:02:46.007 --> 00:02:49.005
as a strategic tool to guide your AI journey,

69
00:02:49.005 --> 00:02:51.003
ensuring that every initiative

70
00:02:51.003 --> 00:02:53.007
contributes to your overarching business goals.
